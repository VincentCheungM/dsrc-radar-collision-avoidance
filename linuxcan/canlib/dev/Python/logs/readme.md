### ALL CANLIB LOG FILES ARE HERE


## NOTES
1) figure out if we can get more usec accuracy on timestamps
2) if the logs dir is deleted, tell the logger to create all necessary directories to get to the place where you save the logs. This file was created as a holder file for the directory so that the folder heirarchy would be pushed to git.


Both of these problems can be fixed by subclassing the Logging framework, but we will deal with these problems when the time comes
